It compares two approaches : Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression
-Naive Bayes is a simple technique for constructing classifiers: models that assign class labels to problem 
instances, represented as vectors of feature values, where the class labels are drawn from some finite set.

-In statistics, the logistic model (or logit model) is a widely used statistical model that, in its basic 
form, uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable; many more complex extensions exist. 
In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a 
logistic model; it is a form of binomial regression.

All the methods are implemented from scratch except basic functions. The data is random which has 4 Attributes and one label.
